# Notes

1. Does Pyre preserve the order of component attributes? We need the order of subfields to be preserved (can use index if necessary)?
2. What is the best way to provide a default component for the elasticity governing equation?
   1. Full component name:  `pylith.app.problem.governing_eqn.solver.petsc_options.solver`
   2. `elasticity` component is `pylith.governing_eqns.elasticity`
   3. `petsc_options` component is `pylith.petsc.options.solver`
   4. `pylith.governing_eqns.elasticity.solver.petsc_options.solver` does not appear to be an alias.
   5. Do I need to define my solver options component with a filepath of something like `pylith.governing_eqns.elasticity.solver`?
